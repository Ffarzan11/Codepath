New Idea for an app: I would like to make an app that would give personlized recommendation of movies, books or places to eat. It would ask couple of questions to generate basic recommendation. The user can also rate some places to show their choices. Based on that it would provide the recommentations. The users can switch between themes. They can post about the books/movies/places they liked. A user can also ask other users for recommendations.
