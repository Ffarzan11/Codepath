## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
favorite applications
Messenger: Changing themes
            Word effects
            Nicknames
            Stories
Instagram: The clean interface
            Notes
Snapchat: deleting messages 

New Idea for an app: I would like to make an app that would give personalized recommendations of movies, books, or places to eat. It would ask a couple of questions to generate basic recommendations. The user can also rate some places to show their choices. Based on that it would provide the recommendations. The users can switch between themes. They can post about the books/movies/places they liked. A user can also ask other users for recommendations.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
